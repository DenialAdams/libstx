oystr is a simple C string library focused on being easy to use, fast, and
compatible with standard C-style strings. This is accomplished by fully exposing the
oystr struct, and allowing both stack allocated and dynamically allocated
oystr objects to work for any function provided by the library (with some
caveats).

The library aims to be simple and optimized for statically linking, as each
function is compiled to seperate object files which then compose the library
archive.

Further documentation can be found in the man-pages found in this repository
under "doc/".
