.SH NAME
libistr \- Improved String Library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libistr.h>
.PP
.B typedef struct 
.I istring istring;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The istring library (hereafter referred to as libistr) is an efficient and 
simple dynamic string library for C. It provides the istring structure and 
functions that operate on them. istrings are fully compatible with the 
standard ANSI C <string.h> functions with access to their character buffers,
however, an istring is not required to contain a terminating null-byte and
none of the library functions require a terminating null-byte unless 
specifically required (For interoperability with existing C strings).
As a bonus because of this, istrings can be used to hold arbitrary data
inside of them with no worries of the library modifying the data in unexpected
ways (libistr will NEVER automatically insert a null-byte for you).
.PP
libistr includes utf8 helper functions that let unicode characters be
manipulated by the number of unicode characters rather than the size in bytes.
.PP
Memory allocation for istrings is also efficient, as the scheme for increasing
an istring's size is to keep it as a power of two e.g. 32, 64, 512.
