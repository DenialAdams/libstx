.SH NAME
 stxeq - Check for equality between with two spx structs.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libstx.h>

.B bool stxeq(spx \fIs1\fP, spx \fIs2\fP);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B stxeq()
compares the contents of 
.I s1
and
.I s2
to eachother for equality. This means that s1.len = s2.len, and s1.mem = s2.mem.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B stxeq()
returns true if both spx structs contain equivalent lengths, and their memory
buffers contain equivalent characters up to that length. Returns false if any of
the prior criteria don't hold.
